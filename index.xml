      <description>Hello! Welcome to my blog. I&amp;rsquo;m currently an engineer at Etsy. Previously, I was at UC Berkeley, where I did research on income inequality and wrote for the school paper, amongst other things. I like reading about economics, history, and literature. For now, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to teach myself generative art and Spanish. Hit me up.</description>
